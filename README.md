# Faiyt's UI Compoennts

This is a number of react components I am building to support Faiyt.dev application and any other 
websites that I might build beyond that. 

## Components
It includes the following component types. 
- controls
- inputs
- layout
- type
- utilities


These components are to be designed as modular as possible to allow
them to be reused and styled as needed for each of the projects requirements.
